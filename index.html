<p> I decided to make my drawing machine about the effects of light pollution.
</p>
<p1>Under our San Jose sky we barely get to see any stars if any at all
This project shows what our sky is supposed to look like behind the
layers of pollution that get in our way between it and us. </p1>
<p2>Have fun enjoying a rarely seen sky and draw your own constillations much
like how our pre-industrial time ancestors did</p2>
